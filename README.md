# Smart Ball

This project is designed for a soccer team coach to follow the soccer team players during training. In particular it was aimed to measure the hit and speed values ​​during rust and shot training. The project consists of two parts, physical and software. The physical part detects the ball with sensors and transfers the results to the software, while the software part processes and records the incoming data. The data is stored on the device with the software. After the exercises are performed, the data stored in the device can be evaluated for each football player and their development can be observed. Thus, the coach can analyze his team more easily.

## Getting Started

Download a copy of the project files to your local machine to run the project. Obtain the necessary environments and electronic materials. Install the necessary circuit with the materials you have acquired. Install the software on any android device. Communicate with the circuit through the software and start using it.

### Prerequisites

- Sensors and materials required for the circuit
- A device with Android software system
- Android Studio
- Arduino
- Arduino IDE

To run the project, first get any version of the IDE software suitable for your system from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install it on your local machine. Then open the files for android software that you downloaded to your local machine in this environment. After making the necessary adjustments, get the apk extension of the application. Upload this file to a device with android software.

Get the necessary materials for Arduino and create the circuit. Obtain any version of IDE software for your system from [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) for Arduino and install it on your local machine. Install the Arduino software to the processor with the Arduino IDE by making the Arduino-pc connection. Establish a bluetooth connection between the circuit that is running and the application.
